 <summary><h3>🌹 Manaroz's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science enthusiast, eager to learn everything I could about the programming world. While teaching myself development, I dreamed of building my own app, but that dream was soon overshadowed by my desire to master C# and .NET. That passion eventually led me to study computer science.
Still, something about my path kept bothering me — abandoning my dream of creating something of my own just to follow the safe route of getting a job. That’s why I stepped away from programming for a while and started working in a law firm’s office, choosing stability over passion.
   Now it’s time for a change I’m truly ready for. I’ve already taken the leap away from that safety net and back into the exciting world of programming. This time I’m especially fascinated by the open-source community and contributing to real projects that make a difference.
